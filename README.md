# Background
To some extent, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The wealthy have access to more resources, which leads to a better portfolio. Since poorer people do not know as much information, their decisions will be limited. 
When it comes to financing, more information often means more possibilities. To address the inequality in financial investment, we will integrate assets across the platform to provide them with personalized investment decisions through analyzing user information.

Using the userâ€™s risk aversion compared to their desired return, we can create a simple portfolio within a certain budget from 20 preselected risky and safe assets such as stocks and bonds using live prices. We could briefly inform the user of their perceived risk aversion and why their optimal assets address financial literacy. 


# Details
With the user information obtained from the front-end, we will use the Heckman method to quantitatively analyze the data and give the user risk aversion index based on the model.
Heckman two-step control function: a statistical technique to correct bias from non-randomly selected samples for quantitative social sciences.
